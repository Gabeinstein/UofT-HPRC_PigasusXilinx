WARNING: [DRC PDCN-1569] LUT equation term check: Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_EXT_BSCAN_WITH_CORE.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_EXT_BSCAN_WITH_CORE.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6+~A6)*((A4*A5)+(A4*(~A5)*(~A1))+((~A4)))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
