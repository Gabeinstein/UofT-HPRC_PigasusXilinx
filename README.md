The Pigasus project is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention firewall hardware implementation that achieves 100Gbps performance using a single FPGA. Developed by Professor James Hoe's research group at Carnegie Mellon, this project aims to deliver a 100x improvement over typical datacenter implementations, reducing the need from 21 server CPUs to a single Intel Stratix 10 FPGA.

My project, supervised by Professor Paul Chow as part of the High Performance Reconfigurable Computing Research Group at the University of Toronto, involved implementing Pigasus on AMD-based FPGA boards. My main contribution was solving the memory incompatibility between Intel's Avalon Memory interfaces and AMD Ultrascale+ MPSoC BRAM management. Pigasus aims to be deployed in a multi-FPGA management system that handles datacenter hardware resources across a wide range of FPGA boards, including the Sidewinder-100, Alveo U200, U250, U280, and VCK5000.
